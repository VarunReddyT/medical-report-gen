        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          This is an interesting performance subtest that measures visual motor skill. Coding gives 
          clues to basic deficiencies in visual motor performance needed for writing. Good short-
          term memory improves performance on coding. It also factors with freedom from 
          distractibility and the ability to concentrate to accomplish a visual motor task within time 
          constraints. On this subtest Sadhvi has scored Average level of Performance.
